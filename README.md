> A app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information. Using the Random User Generator API I’ve requested a JSON object and parsed the data so that 50 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address. In this project, I’ve used plain javascript to execute a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance a web page’s usability. The solutions I’ve built are flexible enough to handle arrays of employee data of various lengths, no matter how many employees are added. I implemented a search bar dynamically with javascript that when performed, the data is filtered so that only those name that includes the search value are shown.
